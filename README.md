## Embedding Fonts
This small app is intended for use with prototypes made with Axure RP. Often times users find that they need to use certain fonts, but those fonts might not be hosted online and available for use, or prototypes might be used offline and the necessary font isn't guaranteed to be installed on the system viewing the prototype.

By encoding the font file itself and embedding it in a font-face declaration, no external resources are necessary to use the font. 

_Note that this is not intended for any kind of production use, and is intended specifically for prototype scenarios_.
